## A CNN model is designed to classify chest X-ray images with high accuracy. 
It likely includes several convolutional and pooling layers for feature extraction, followed by fully connected layers for classification. Data augmentation and transfer learning might be used to enhance performance, 
achieving 87% accuracy in distinguishing between “Normal” and “Pneumonia” categories.
